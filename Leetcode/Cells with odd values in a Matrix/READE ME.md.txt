// 1252. Cells with Odd Values in a Matrix
// There is an m x n matrix that is initialized to all 0's. There is also a 2D array indices where each 
// indices[i] = [ri, ci] represents a 0-indexed location to perform some increment operations on the matrix.
// For each location indices[i], do both of the following:
// Increment all the cells on row ri.
// Increment all the cells on column ci.
// Given m, n, and indices, return the number of odd-valued cells in the matrix after applying the increment 
// to all locations in indices
